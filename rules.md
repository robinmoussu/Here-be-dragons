# First game turn

Each player **place his piece** on one of the hexagons, then choose 3 resources**:

| turn order | common resource | rare resource | precious resource |
|:----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|
| 1 | 3 | – | – |
| 2 | 2 | 1 | – |

# Game turn:

## Production:

The governor of each city **add 1 resource in on of the district of each of his cities** (but not in the forum). Only a **maximum of 1 resource per district** and **6 in total in the city** (including the resources inside the forum coming from previous exchanges).  The total number of resources stored in the forum are only limited by the total number of resources in the city. The supplementary resources are **destroyed**.

## Action phase:

The player whose turn it is can do up to 4 actions (it's possible to do multiple times the same one):

 - **Moving**: Move yourself on an already explored adjacent hexagon.
 - **Exploration**: When you are on the edge of the map, you can explore. Draw 2 tiles of the same region than the one were you currently are. Choose one, and put it on any free space next to your caravan. Exploring yield **1 crown**.
 - **Construction**: Build a city on the spot of your caravan, provided that the districts of that new city will not overlap with the districts of an existing city. You will become the governor of that city. When all the district of the city will be explored (if it's not already the case), the governor will gain purchase skills of the resource negotiated of the forum (see the section trading just below).
 - **Trading**: You can trade when you are in the forum of any city. Trading in one of your own city will make you **loose 1 influence point** (those you cannot exchange in your own city if you don't have victory points). The exchange rate in given below:

 * **2 crowns** per resource
 * **-1** if either have a **purchase skill** for that resource, or if you are the **governor of that city** and your are buying something from the forum. Those advantages don't hold concurrently.
 * **+1** if that resource is **exotic** (a resource is considered exotic if it is not present on any of the hexagons of the city, neither in the forum, nor in the districts).
 
 The  resources sold in a city are **preserved in the forum** if you are a normal merchant, and **put back in the stock** if you are the governor.
 
 It's also possible to make exchanges with other caravan that are on the same hexagon than you, even outside of a city (the exchange rate is being left to the discretion of the players).

## Investment phase:

The active player can choose to invest resources wherever he is. Investing give you as much influence points as **the number of resources invested minus 2**. All invested resources must be of a different type. Crowns cannot be invested.

## Lighting of caravans:

At the end of his game turn, a caravan cannot carry more than **10 resources** (crowns are considered as resources in the computation of the number of transportable resources). Exceeding have to be discarded. It's obviously often better to invests them.
